# Sentinel-Gemini Roadmap — 0.x → 1.0

> Last updated: 2026-04-22 | Current version: `v0.50.6`

## Product vision

**Sentinel-Gemini is an SRE/FinOps tool for small engineering teams** — teams that need cost management and reliability without a dedicated specialist. Startups, scale-ups and platform squads that don't have the budget for Datadog/New Relic but need fast answers about cluster health and cost.

> **Guiding principle:** Observability-first, intelligence-second. Didactic, lean, actionable.

## Product principles

- **Standalone first** — no Prometheus, Grafana or AlertManager required
- **Intelligence second** — if the analysis layer goes down, Sentinel-Gemini keeps working through deterministic rules
- **Collection doesn't decide** — collection, calculation and presentation are separate layers
- **UI doesn't calculate** — business logic stays in the backend
- **Deterministic rules before generative intelligence**
- **Didactic by default** — every metric must be self-explanatory; tooltips and legends are part of the product, not separate documentation
- **No system noise** — k8s infra namespaces (`kube-system`, `kubernetes-dashboard`, etc.) are excluded by default from governance panels; users don't control them
- **UNMANAGED is its own category** — pods without `resources.requests` are not "inefficient" (grade F), they are a scheduler blind spot and FinOps risk; they deserve their own badge and alert
- **Sort on every tile with columns** — any table in the dashboard must be sortable; standard via `attachPanelSortHandlers()`

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Continuous collection via Metrics API | ✅ Done |
| PostgreSQL persistence (raw + hourly + daily) | ✅ Done |
| Configurable 3-tier retention | ✅ Done |
| Waste calculation per pod (`potentialSavingMCpu`) | ✅ Done |
| Base dashboard (HTML + API) | ✅ Done |
| Stable API (`/api/summary`, `/api/metrics`, `/api/history`) | ✅ Done |

| Dynamic version badge in dashboard (via `/health`) | ✅ Done |
| Data fallback for long ranges (30d/90d/1y) | ✅ Done |

**Done criterion:** ✅ Sentinel collects, persists, calculates waste and reports its own health without manual intervention.

---

### M2 — Actionable FinOps ✅ (`v0.10.15`)

**Goal:** You can identify where the waste is and prioritize fixes.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Pod waste ranking (top N) | ✅ Done (`/api/waste` + sortable drawer) |
| Waste analysis by namespace | ✅ Done (`/api/waste` with breakdown) |
| Waste analysis by deployment | ✅ Done (`appLabel` in `WasteEntry`, "By Deployment" view in drawer) |
| Request vs usage comparison per pod (explicit) | ✅ Done (pod detail drawer: CPU/Mem bars + rightsizing) |
| Overprovisioning detection (request >> real usage) | ✅ Done (via `applyWasteAnalysis`) |
| Namespace efficiency score | ✅ Done (`/api/efficiency`, grades A→F + UNMANAGED, full-width panel) |
| Cost forecast with linear regression | ✅ Done (`/api/forecast`) |
| Cost history (30m/1h/6h/24h/7d/30d/90d/1y) | ✅ Done |

**Done criterion:** ✅ Can answer "which namespace / deployment is wasting the most?" with data from the dashboard or API.

**Dependencies:** M1 ✅

---

### M3 — Deterministic incident intelligence ✅ Done (`v0.11`)

**Goal:** Sentinel generates useful diagnosis even without AI, with APIs documented and individually monitored.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Thresholds read from `config/thresholds.yaml` in Go agent | ✅ Done |
| Automatic violation detection (CPU, memory, pod health) | ✅ Done |
| `severity` field in API endpoints | ✅ Done |
| Simple correlation (pod in CrashLoop + high CPU usage) | ✅ Done |
| Deterministic operational summary at `/api/incidents` | ✅ Done |
| Consumption of `/api/incidents` by the Dashboard UI | ✅ Done |
| Per-endpoint health check in `/health` (`checks.apis`) with individual latency | ✅ Done |
| `/status` page displays per-component status (APIM-style) | ✅ Done |
| `openapi.yaml` embedded in binary covering all endpoints | ✅ Done |
| Swagger UI at `/docs` (via CDN, no external build dependency) | ✅ Done |

**Done criterion:** Sentinel detects and classifies incidents via thresholds without needing the LLM, each endpoint has individually monitorable status, and any dev can explore the API via `/docs`.

**Dependencies:** M1 ✅

---

### M4 — Critical Resilience & Security ✅ Done (`v0.11.3` → `v0.12`)

**Goal:** Secure the agent for public release and ensure data resilience before pushing to production-like environments.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL PersistentVolumeClaim by default | ✅ Done |
| API Authentication (AuthMiddleware) enabled by default | ✅ Done |
| GitHub Actions CI pipeline (go test + helm lint) | ✅ Done |
| Circuit breaker for PostgreSQL (staleness flag on /health) | ✅ Done |
| Exponential backoff in collector goroutine | ✅ Done |
| Document environment variables and defaults | ✅ Done |
| Configurable FinOps pricing (price per mCPU/MiB) | ✅ Done |
| **Busting Cache System** for UI scripts | ✅ Done |
| **Security gap — AUTH_TOKEN**: fail-fast on boot if `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and token empty | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| **Security gap — /health**: strip raw internal error strings from unauthenticated response | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| **Security gap — XSS**: restore DOMPurify in `drawerHTML()`; escape `opportunity`, `namespace`, `grade` in innerHTML | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| **Security gap — Helm**: `required` guard on `agent.auth.token`; remove hardcoded default | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| **JS modularization**: split 2,786-line `dashboard.js` into 7 modules under `static/js/`; switch to `embed.FS` | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |

**Done criterion:** ✅ Sentinel can survive a pod restart without data loss, the API requires auth outside of local environments, CI runs on every PR, and no hardcoded credentials exist in the codebase.

**Dependencies:** M3 ✅

---

### M5 — Optional intelligence ✅ Done (`v0.35`)

**Goal:** The intelligence layer improves the experience but is not required for the core.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `/incident` consumes deterministic `/api/incidents` first | ✅ Done |
| `Narrative string` field in `Incident` struct (`omitempty`, backward-compatible) | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| Narrative rendered in Alerts drawer when populated (collapsible "Why?" block) | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| Degraded mode: if intelligence layer unavailable, returns deterministic analysis | ✅ Done |
| Harness M5 remediation guard: block `kubectl exec`, `kubectl scale --replicas=0`, `helm uninstall`, `kubectl apply -f -`, `kubectl patch replicas:0` | ✅ Done (`v0.12`) |
| **Honeycomb UI**: Datadog-style auto-scaling visual maps | ✅ Done (`v0.34`) |
| **Node Detail**: Saturation bars + pod list per node | ✅ Done (`v0.34`) |
| **UX Alignment**: Back buttons + event delegation | ✅ Done (`v0.34`) |
| Automatic runbooks based on templates + variables | ✅ Done (`v0.34`) |
| **LLM provider interface** (`pkg/llm`): `Provider` interface + Ollama skeleton + graceful fallback | ✅ Done (`v0.35`) |
| **Copy button XSS fix**: `data-runbook` + `addEventListener` (DOMPurify-safe) | ✅ Done (`v0.35`) |
| **Runbook accuracy**: `ErrImagePull` / `CreateContainerConfigError` → `kubectl describe` | ✅ Done (`v0.35`) |
| **Tests for `pkg/llm`**: 4 unit tests covering all `NewClient()` branches | ✅ Done (`v0.35`) |
| Possible local model support (Ollama — full implementation) | Future (post-M6) |

**Done criterion:** ✅ `/incident` works without external models and produces usable diagnosis with a visual-first UI that scales. LLM provider interface in place for future enrichment without blocking deterministic mode.

**Dependencies:** M4 ✅

---

### M6 — Real lab / QA / Prod-Like (`v0.50`)

**Goal:** Validate Sentinel against a realistic workload before any documentation or contract is frozen. Surface gaps in the API, UX and observability that only emerge under real traffic.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Documented Online Boutique baseline (namespace `google-demo`) | ✅ Done |
| Controlled load (e.g. hey, k6) on microservices | ✅ Done |
| Burst and fault injection documented | ✅ Done |
| Before/after comparison in dashboard | ✅ Done |
| Lab incident report with generated runbook | ✅ Done |

**Done criterion:** Report comparing normal vs degraded cluster state produced by Sentinel, serving as community proof-of-concept. API and UI gaps identified for M7 stabilization.

**Dependencies:** M5

---

### M7 — v1.0 preparation (`v0.99`)

**Goal:** You'd call it 1.0 without technical embarrassment. Stabilize and document based on what M6 revealed under real load.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Documentation for all endpoints (OpenAPI or Markdown) | Pending |
| Stable API contracts (no breaking changes) | Pending |
| Revised dashboard UX (visual consistency, responsiveness) | Pending |
| Clean configuration (no undocumented env vars) | Pending |
| README reflecting real project state | Pending |
| Predictable failure behavior (graceful degradation) | Pending |
| Integration tests for API contracts | Pending |

**Done criterion:** Another developer can clone, configure and run Sentinel without help.

**Dependencies:** M6

## Backlog by priority

### High priority (v0.50)
- M6: Online Boutique lab: baseline + load + comparison

### Medium priority (v0.50+)
- CrashLoop pod + CPU correlation (refinamento)
- M7: API stability & full OpenAPI coverage (after M6 reveals gaps)

### Low priority / future
- Multi-cluster (post-1.0)
- Local model / Ollama (post-1.0)

## Core vs Support vs Luxury

| Category | Items |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Kubernetes collection, waste calculation, pod/namespace analysis, history, dashboard, stable API, `/health`, behavior without LLM |
| **Support** | Structured logs, health checks, retries, schema validation, internal metrics, degraded mode, Markdown/JSON export |
| **Luxury** | LLM for narrative analysis, automatic runbooks, intelligent executive summary, local model, AI-driven trends, multi-cluster |

---

## Product rules

- If the LLM goes down, Sentinel stays useful
- If the dashboard fails, the API must still be usable
- If the cluster changes, the contracts must hold
- If the project grows, the core must not lose simplicity
