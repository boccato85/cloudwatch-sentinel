# Sentinel Roadmap — 0.x → 1.0

> Last updated: 2026-04-24 | Current version: `v1.0.0-rc.2`

## Product vision

**Sentinel is an SRE/FinOps tool for small engineering teams** — teams that need cost management and reliability without a dedicated specialist. Startups, scale-ups and platform squads that don't have the budget for Datadog/New Relic but need fast answers about cluster health and cost.

> **Guiding principle:** Observability-first, intelligence-second. Didactic, lean, actionable.

## Product principles

- **Standalone first** — no Prometheus, Grafana or AlertManager required
- **Intelligence second** — if the analysis layer goes down, Sentinel keeps working through deterministic rules
- **Collection doesn't decide** — collection, calculation and presentation are separate layers
- **UI doesn't calculate** — business logic stays in the backend
- **Deterministic rules before generative intelligence**
- **Didactic by default** — every metric must be self-explanatory; tooltips and legends are part of the product, not separate documentation
- **No system noise** — k8s infra namespaces (`kube-system`, `kubernetes-dashboard`, etc.) are excluded by default from governance panels; users don't control them
- **UNMANAGED is its own category** — pods without `resources.requests` are not "inefficient" (grade F), they are a scheduler blind spot and FinOps risk; they deserve their own badge and alert
- **Sort on every tile with columns** — any table in the dashboard must be sortable; standard via `attachPanelSortHandlers()`

## Execution Priority Track (P0-P3)

Milestones (`M1`-`M8`) define strategic product evolution. Priorities (`P0`-`P3`) define tactical execution order across issues/Project.

| Priority | Scope | Current status | Roadmap mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | v1.0 release hardening gate | ✅ Done | Final hardening after M7 (`v1.0.0-rc.2`) |
| P1 | Immediate post-release operational strengthening | 🟡 Planned | Post-v1.0 track before M8 feature expansion |
| P2 | Post-release maturity improvements | 🟡 Planned | Post-v1.0 maturity track, still before UX polish |
| P3 | UX hardening and product polish | 🟡 Planned | Milestone `v1.1 (M8)` execution lane in GitHub Project |

Execution order: `P1` -> `P2` -> `P3`.

> Release-readiness hardening for `v1.0.0-rc.2` is tracked in the GitHub Project "Sentinel v1.0 Release Readiness" and covers version alignment, ingress-first deploy, support matrix, release notes and quality evidence. Current P0 status: `#19`–`#24` done (all P0 closed).
>
> Post-v1.0 execution order: finish `P1` then `P2`; UX hardening is tracked as `P3` (milestone `v1.1 (M8)`) in the GitHub Project.

| **Tests for `pkg/llm`**: 4 unit tests covering all `NewClient()` branches | ✅ Done (`v0.35`) |

**Done criterion:** ✅ `/incident` works without external models and produces usable diagnosis with a visual-first UI that scales. LLM provider interface in place for cloud enrichment in M8 without blocking deterministic mode.

**Dependencies:** M4 ✅

### M7 — v1.0 preparation ✅ Done (`v1.0.0-rc.2`)

**Goal:** You'd call it 1.0 without technical embarrassment. Stabilize and document based on what M6 revealed under real load.

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Documentation for all endpoints (OpenAPI or Markdown) | ✅ Done — full OpenAPI spec (15 endpoints, all schemas, securitySchemes) |
| Stable API contracts (no breaking changes) | ✅ Done — contracts frozen, documented in `openapi.yaml` |

**Done criterion:** ✅ Another developer can clone, configure and run Sentinel without help.

**Dependencies:** M6

### M8 — Sentinel Intelligence 🔵 Planned (`v1.1`)

**Goal:** Add a dedicated Intelligence interface to Sentinel — a separate window from the operational dashboard — that runs **agentic investigation workflows**: the LLM acts as an orchestrator that calls read-only kubectl tools, correlates evidence, and proposes remediation steps. The user confirms before any action executes. Narrative text and reports are workflow outputs, not the product.

**Agentic workflow model:**

```
User opens incident in Intelligence window
  → LLM receives incident context from /api/incidents
  → LLM calls tools (describe, logs, top, events) to collect evidence
  → LLM synthesises root cause from tool outputs
  → LLM proposes next action (e.g. "scale deployment X", "apply patch Y")
  → User confirms / modifies / rejects
  → Agent executes (dry-run first, then live on explicit confirm)
  → Workflow trace written to report via harness
```

**Design constraints:**
- Intelligence window is additive — operational dashboard keeps working if M8 is disabled or the LLM is unreachable
- All LLM-generated content passes through `harness/output_validator.py` before being written or rendered
- Every agentic action requires explicit human confirmation; write-path ops require a dry-run step first
- MVP tool scope is read-only (`describe`, `logs`, `top`, `get events`) — no destructive ops
- Cloud LLM is opt-in; `SENTINEL_LLM_API_KEY` absence disables the Intelligence window gracefully

**Deliverables:**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Cloud LLM provider implementation (`pkg/llm`): Gemini and/or OpenAI concrete clients | 🔵 Planned |
| `SENTINEL_LLM_PROVIDER`, `SENTINEL_LLM_API_KEY`, `SENTINEL_LLM_MODEL` env vars + Helm values | 🔵 Planned |
| **Intelligence window** — new UI panel separate from operational dashboard | 🔵 Planned |
| Agentic tool definitions: `kubectl_describe`, `kubectl_logs`, `kubectl_top`, `kubectl_events` (read-only, RBAC-scoped) | 🔵 Planned |
| Workflow engine: tool-call loop, context accumulation, step trace displayed in UI | 🔵 Planned |
| Human-in-the-loop: action proposal rendered with Confirm / Modify / Reject controls before execution | 🔵 Planned |
| Dry-run guard: write-path actions execute as `--dry-run=client` first; live run requires second explicit confirm | 🔵 Planned |
| Report generation: workflow trace + LLM synthesis exported as Markdown via `tools/report_tool.py` | 🔵 Planned |
| Harness integration: all LLM output validated by `harness/output_validator.py` before render or write | 🔵 Planned |
| Graceful degradation: Intelligence window shows deterministic fallback if LLM unavailable | 🔵 Planned |

**Done criterion:** A user can open an incident in the Intelligence window, watch the agent collect evidence via kubectl tools, review the root-cause synthesis, confirm a remediation step, and export the full workflow trace as a report — without touching a terminal.

**Dependencies:** M7 ✅

## Backlog by priority

### High priority (post-1.0)
- **M8 — Sentinel Intelligence** (cloud LLM + agentic window) — see M8 deliverables
- Integration tests for API contracts (deferred from M7)
- Public image on GHCR via first `v1.0-rc1` tag push

### Medium priority (post-1.0)
- CrashLoop pod + CPU correlation (refinement)
- Multi-cluster support

### Low priority / future
- Additional agentic tools (write-path, scale recommendations with confirmation)

---

## Core vs Support vs Intelligence

> Feature classification for scope decisions — not sales tiers. Core and Support are open/free by design. Intelligence features (cloud LLM, agentic) require an external API key and will be opt-in; formal product tiers will be defined when M8 ships.

| Category | Items |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Kubernetes collection, waste calculation, pod/namespace analysis, history, dashboard, stable API, `/health`, behavior without LLM |
| **Support** | Structured logs, health checks, retries, schema validation, internal metrics, degraded mode, Markdown/JSON export |
| **Intelligence** | Agentic investigation workflows (LLM orchestrates kubectl tools → proposes remediation → user confirms), cloud LLM enrichment, report/runbook generation from workflow trace, multi-cluster |

---

## Product rules

- If the LLM goes down, Sentinel stays useful
- If the dashboard fails, the API must still be usable
- If the cluster changes, the contracts must hold
- If the project grows, the core must not lose simplicity
